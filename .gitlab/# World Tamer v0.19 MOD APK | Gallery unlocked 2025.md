## Gameplay:
Exploration and Discovery: The game encourages players to fully explore every corner of the town. With every building, alley, and landmark hiding a story of its own, you’ll need to gather clues, talk to townsfolk, and piece together the fragments of the past. Some places are hidden behind locked doors or secret passages, requiring you to find keys or solve puzzles to gain access. Your goal is to explore not only the town but the memories of those who lived there.

Character Interactions: The town is filled with a diverse cast of characters, each with their own stories, secrets, and motivations. Conversations with these residents can lead to new leads, hidden information, or even unexpected revelations. Building relationships and trust with these individuals may unlock new paths, while betrayal could result in dangerous consequences. Your interactions are key to understanding the town’s complex web of connections.

Unraveling the Mystery: As you piece together the puzzle of your past, you will encounter multiple storylines that intertwine with your own. The game is driven by a series of choices—sometimes subtle, sometimes life-altering—that determine not only your relationship with others but the ultimate direction of the story. Will you find redemption and understanding, or will the darkness of the town consume you?

## Game Features:
Dynamic Story Progression: Your choices are at the heart of the narrative. Every decision you make—whether it’s who to trust, where to investigate, or which path to take—affects the storyline. With multiple branching paths and a variety of potential outcomes, the game offers a unique experience every time you play. The way you interact with characters and uncover the town’s secrets will determine the fate of your story.

Puzzle Solving and Clue Gathering: To uncover the truth, you must solve a variety of puzzles and gather clues from different locations. The game mixes environmental puzzles with dialogue choices, creating an immersive experience where observation and interaction are crucial. The clues you gather will not only help you piece together your parents' mysterious past but also reveal hidden truths about the town’s dark history.

Rich, Immersive World: The town you return to is filled with richly detailed environments and a deep lore that enhances the mystery. Each location, from the abandoned house on the outskirts to the overgrown town square, is filled with history waiting to be discovered. Whether it’s exploring forgotten places or speaking to cryptic residents, every interaction and exploration will reveal more about the dark past you’ve long sought to escape.

## Game Tips:
Take Your Time to Explore: Don’t rush through the game’s areas. The town is full of hidden details that may seem insignificant at first, but can unlock major plot points later. Searching for hidden notes, checking out suspicious objects, and revisiting locations after new revelations will help you gather all the pieces of the puzzle.

Talk to Everyone: The townspeople are key to understanding the bigger picture. Listen carefully to their stories, even if they seem irrelevant at first. Often, what you hear in passing conversations will lead to important clues or even reveal a hidden agenda. Don’t overlook anyone, as even the quietest characters may hold the key to your mystery.

Balance Your Choices: Every decision can have a lasting impact, so think carefully about whom you trust and what paths you choose to follow. Some characters may offer help, but they could also be hiding dangerous secrets. Weigh the risks of your actions, as one wrong choice might alter the course of the investigation and even endanger you or others in the town.
